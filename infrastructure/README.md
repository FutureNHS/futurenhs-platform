# Infrastructure

We use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to build our environments.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Terraform:

   ```bash
   brew install terraform
   ```

1. Install a Terraform version switcher:
   ([Terraform Switcher](https://github.com/warrensbox/terraform-switcher)
   or [CHTF](https://github.com/Yleisradio/homebrew-terraforms))

   ```bash
   brew install warrensbox/tap/tfswitch
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   brew install chtf
   ```

1. Select version 0.12.25:

   ```bash
   tfswitch 0.12.25
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   chtf 0.12.25
   ```

1. Install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest):

   ```bash
   brew install azure-cli
   ```

1. Login to Azure:

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

1. Install the [Linkerd CLI](https://linkerd.io/2/getting-started/):

   ```bash
   brew install linkerd
   ```

## Development Environment

Infrastructure is set up so that each developer can create their own instance of the environment in Azure,
as opposed to sharing a staging environment.

1. Clone the FutureNHS Platform.

1. Create the new dev environment with **your name** as the parameter.

   If your name is **John**, your command is as follows:

   ```bash
   ./infrastructure/scripts/create-dev-environment.sh john
   ```

1. Change directory into the dev environment folder:

   ```bash
   cd infrastructure/environments/dev
   ```

1. Run Terraform Init using the vars file you just created:

   ```bash
   terraform init -backend-config=terraform.tfvars
   ```

1. Create an execution plan:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

1. After verifying the plan above, apply changes. The infrastructure will be created in Azure.

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

1. Give the Kubernetes cluster permissions to pull images from our Docker registry.

   As with step 2, if your name is **John**, your command will be:

   ```bash
   az aks update -n dev-john -g platform-dev-john --attach-acr "/subscriptions/75173371-c161-447a-9731-f042213a19da/resourceGroups/platform-production/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/fnhsproduction"
   ```

1. In order to use Kubernetes CLI (kubectl) commands, you need to pull the credentials from the server.

   As with step 2, if your name is **John**, your command will be:

   ```bash
   az aks get-credentials --resource-group platform-dev-john --name dev-john
   ```

1. To install the [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/) control plane, run the `install-linkerd.sh` script that can be found within `infrastructure/scripts` directory.

   ```bash
   ./install-linkerd.sh
   ```

   Once installed, view the Linkerd dashboard with the following command:

   ```bash
   linkerd dashboard &
   ```

1. install Argo CD [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/) (insert instructions here with a script) run the `install-argo-cd.sh` script that can be found within `infrastructure/scripts` directory.

   ```bash
   ./install-argo-cd.sh
   ```

   Once the pods are ready, ArgoCD will be running. But it will not be accessible from outside the cluster. Use port-forward to expose a port to the service, and forward it to localhost.

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
   ```

   Your ArgoCD cluster will be available at https://localhost:8080. Leave the port-forward running in the foreground of your terminal. Open another terminal window.

   In the UI, you will not be able to log in yet.

   The initial password is autogenerated to be the pod name of the Argo CD API server. This can be retrieved with the command:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n argocd -l app.kubernetes.io/name=argocd-server -o name | cut -d'/' -f 2
   ```

   Using the username admin and the password from above, login to Argo via localhost

   ```bash
   argocd login https://localhost:8080
   ```

   Change the password using the command:

   ```bash
   argocd account update-password
   ```

   To create an app to deploy run the following:

   ```bash
   argocd app create <appname> --repo <repo url> --path <appname> --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc --dest-namespace default
   ```

   Navigate to the port specified in your deployment.yml and the app should be up and running!

1. To reduce infrastructure costs for the NHS, please destroy your environment when you no longer need it.

   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

## Production environment

Production is a long-lived environment. To make changes, follow these steps.

The `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` environment variable is needed if you're using Azure CLI authentication and production is not your default subscription (which is recommended).

1. Change directory into the dev environment folder:

   ```bash
   cd infrastructure/environments/production
   ```

1. Run Terraform Init using the vars file you just created:

   ```bash
   ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=75173371-c161-447a-9731-f042213a19da terraform init
   ```

1. Create an execution plan:

   ```bash
   ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=75173371-c161-447a-9731-f042213a19da terraform plan
   ```

1. After verifying the plan above, apply changes. The infrastructure will be created in Azure.

   ```bash
   ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=75173371-c161-447a-9731-f042213a19da terraform apply
   ```

## Troubleshooting

1. If an error occurs when applying the terroform it is possible that there is a cached version of an existing terraform set up. You can overcome this by deleting the ./infrastructure/environments/dev/.terraform/ folder and trying again.
